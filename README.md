# RP\_Friends
 Customizable friendslist replacement on WoW

## Current Status

~~As I no longer play World of Warcraft, this addon is no longer being maintained.~~
~~Therefore I've converted this repository to a public archive.~~

Update (**as of 2022/09/11**):

I've started playing WoW again! Therefore I feel obligated to go back to working on this.
I've unarchived the repositories for this and other RP\_\* addons on GitHub, and will be
updating their Interface numbers to the current Wow (retail) versions.

## To Do:

- [x] Update TOC to current version of WoW
- [ ] Update libraries
  - [ ] LibCustomGlow
  - [ ] LibDBIcon
  - [ ] LibMSP
  - [ ] LibRealmInfo
  - [ ] LibStub
  - [ ] LibTourist
- [ ] Update configuration system
