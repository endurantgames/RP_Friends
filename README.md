# RP\_Friends
 Customizable friendslist replacement on WoW

## To Do:

- [ ] Update TOC for WoW 9.0.5
- [ ] Update libraries
- [ ] Update configuration

## Current Status

~~As I no longer play World of Warcraft, this addon is no longer being maintained.~~
~~Therefore I've converted this repository to a public archive.~~

Update (**as of 2022/09/11**):

I've started playing WoW again! Therefore I feel obligated to go back to working on this.
I've unarchived the repositories for this and other RP\_\* addons on GitHub, and will be
updating their Interface numbers to the current Wow (retail) versions.
